## List of Features

1. Users can make an account and follow their favorite players and teams.

2. Based, on those followed players and teams, AI generated articles are sent to the user's email address, tailored to their interests, on the daily. The email frequency can also be changed by the user if they prefer it to be on a particular day of the week or month. Users also have the option to save the generated article from their email client. Users have the option to unsubscribe from this feature at anytime too.

3. Users can provide prompts to generate graphs to visualize baseball data. Players can re-name the graph title and labels, as they see fit. They can also save the graph.

4. Users can search for players and teams or filter by their followed players and teams.

5. Automatically, the system can find related content towards a player or team and list it for the user. Users can then save this related content as they see fit.

6. There is a section that lists the user's saved content, which includes videos, articles, and graphs. From this section, users can generate a summary of the videos and download articles to a PDF document. The user can also change the color of the graph from this section as well.

7. On the home page, users can add their saved content to a baseball dashboard in order to have all their preferences visible at the first login of the website. There is also a hidden easter egg of random home runs of the user's followed players being generated on the home page that can be toggled off and on.
