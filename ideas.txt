Gemini to:
    1) Summarize and generate engaging commentary around highlights and news.
        1.1) Use for context generation, ensuring that commentary is tailored
            to the user's preferences (e.g. highlighting specific players
                or games they are following.)

    2) Need to create framework for generating and delivering content in different
        formats (text, audio, video) that fans can consume.

    Text Digest Generation:
    News Summarization: Use Gemini to summarize long articles into shorter digestible text.
        Can use modal to generate personalized summaries, based on teams, players, or topics
        that the user is following. These summaries can be sent to a newsletter-style system to fans.
    Event-driven commentary: Automatically generate and personalize match commentary or updates. 
        Fans could receive a digest of key events for games they follow (e.g. final scores,
            player performances, major match events.)
    
    Audio Digest Creation:
        Text-to-Speech: Use Google Cloud Text-to-Speech or other similar services to convert
            your generated text digests into high-quality audio. Fans can choose to listen to
            the digest, so your system will need a voice selection (male/female, accent, etc.)
            and a cadence (daily, weekly).

        Podcast Integration: If fans enjoy spoken content more, allow them to subscribe
            to podcasts that summarize the news and match events, featuing commentary
            from experts or AI-generated discussions.

        Video Digest Creation:
            Video highlights with AI-generated commentary: Use gemini to generate video
                summaries, adding dynamic text commentary or voiceover to match hightlight
                videos. You can pull clips from the games and add AI-generated narration
                based on the highlights that the fans are most interested in.

                Automated video clips from public sources: You can integrate APIs from platforms
                like Youtube, Twitter, or Instagram to automatically fetch and curate short video
                clips of key events related to the fan's followed players or teams.

        Multilingual Support:
            Since you're targetting English, Spanish, and Japanese-speaking fans...
            Multilingual Content Creation: Use Google Translate (or similar service)
            in conjunction with your AI models to generate content in all three languages.
            You'll need to fine-tune the AI-generated commentary and summaries in each
            language to make them fluent and context-appropriate (e.g. specific
            football terminology in each language.)

            Text-to-Speech in Multiple Languages: Ensure that the text-to-speech engine
            you use (like Google Cloud Text-to-Speech) supports voice output
            in English, Spanish, and Japanese. This will allow fans to hear digests 
            in their preferred language.
            
            Localized Content Generation: You can have region-specific content
                for commentary tailored to cultural preferences in addition to the  
                language barrier.

        Personalization & User Preferences:
        
        Allow users to specify what kind of digest they want:
        - Frequency of Updates: Allow fans to select how often they receive their
            digest (daily, weekly, after every game, etc.)
        - Type of Content: Let them choose the type they want to receive: highlight
            videos, player stats, news articles, etc.
        - Custom Commentary: Allow them to set preferences on commentary tone (e.g.
            formal, casual, humorous) and depth (e.g. brief vs. detailed analysis)

        You could also provide recommendations based on what content they engage
        with the most, allowing the system to be more adaptive.

Push Notifications and Delivery:
- Once the digest content is created in your desired formats (audio, video, text),
you'll need to deliver them to the user.
    - Email: Deliver text-based digest to the user's inbox. This can be easily personalized
    with highlights, commentary, and stats.
    Mobile push notifications: Allow push notifications for audio/video highlights and major
    game events.
    Social media platforms: Search video clips or audio updates directly on user's Social
    media accounts if they're integrated them with your platform.
    Mobile App/Website: Build a section where users can access their personalized feeds,
    including digest options that allow them to listen to or to watch content directly in
    your app.

Potential Technologies & Tools:
- Google Gemini (or GPT-based models): For content generation, summaries, commentary.
- Google Cloud Text-to-Speech or Amazon Polly: For text-to-audio conversion.
- Google Video Intelligence API: To automatically tag and categorized video highlights.
- Video editing tools (like FFmpeg) to stitch highlights into personalized videos with
    commentary.
- Youtube API, Twitter, API, or Intstagram Graph API for integrating user-generated video content.
- Localization Tools: Use services like Google Translate API for multilingual translation,
ensuring quality control for sports-specific terminology.

Example Workflow:
1. Fan selects the teams/players they want to follow.
2. Content is aggregated from news sources, social media, match highlights, and statistics.
3. AI models (like Gemini) summarize content and create personalized text commentary.
4. Text is converted to speech for audio digests or used to create personalized video highlights.
5. Digest is sent via email, app notifications, or other delivery methods in the fan's
    preferred language.

By combing AI for content generation, machine translation for multilingual support,
and tools for media creation and delivery, you can build a robost and engaging
system for fans to stay updated on their favorite teams and players.
