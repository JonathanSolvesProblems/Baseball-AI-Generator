Tailored Content: Use the list of followed players to generate tailored content for users. 
    For example, you could show updates, news, statistics, and highlights of their 
    followed players.
Update Frequency: Let users choose how often they receive updates (e.g., daily, weekly) 
    via notifications, emails, or app updates.

Users who follow specific players can receive content like:
    Recent game highlights
    Player statistics and performance reports
    Player-related news and analysis
    Team-related content

Integrating Gemini AI for Personalization:

Gemini AI could be used to generate recommendations based on the users’ follow history or preferences. This could include:
Player Recommendations: Suggest players that the user might be interested in following based on the ones they’ve followed before.
Content Personalization: Use Gemini to analyze the content preferences of users (e.g., types of players, teams, or performance metrics they are interested in) and serve them more personalized content such as statistics, match highlights, or news.
Example of integrating Gemini AI:

Gemini-powered Recommendations:
Based on the user's followed players, Gemini AI can suggest new players to follow or create a personalized highlight reel.
It can analyze historical player performance data, match statistics, and even media sentiment to suggest interesting content to the user.
To integrate Gemini AI, you would:

Use Gemini’s API to analyze the user's data and make recommendations.
Provide AI-driven personalized experiences, such as tailoring news or highlights based on a user’s favorite player or team.
Notifications or Digest System:

Once a user follows a player, you can set up a system that sends out notifications or periodic content digests based on the latest player or team updates.
Notifications can be done through Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or a custom solution where you generate a digest of followed player highlights, stats, and news.
